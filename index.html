They can also influence the distribution of organisms in an ecosystem. <h4>Examples Of Biotic Factors are<ul><li>competition for environmental resources</li><li>grazing - too little leads to dominant plants outcompeting other species, too much reduces species numbers overall. Both decrease biodiversity</li><li>predation - a reduction in predators can lead to an increase in prey. High numbers of prey can lead to overgrazing, which can reduce biodiversity</li></ul></h4></li> <li><strong>Abiotic factors:</strong> are non-living factors that impact an ecosystem. <h4>Examples Of Abiotic Factors are<ul><li>Light Intensity<li>Temperature</li><li>Soil Ph</li><li>Soil moisture</li></ul></h4></li></ol> </div>
